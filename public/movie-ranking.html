<h1>Asma's All Time Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies to date (listed in no particular order).</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>The stop-motion style animation makes this a spooky masterpiece. 
   The story, too, is rich with detail. A halloween classic in my opinion.</p>

<h3>Boy and The Beast</h3>
<p>A heroic story of a boy being an outcast in a strange land, but
   finding family in a not so friendly beast. Super cool fight sequences 
   and scenes that will make you cry your heart out.</p>
   
<h3>Vivah</h3>
<p>This movie is just a bundle of nostalgia, comedy, romance, music, and culture. 
   Just takes me back to when I was a kid with my sisters and cousins in grandma's room
   wanting to be the female lead in another universe.</p>
